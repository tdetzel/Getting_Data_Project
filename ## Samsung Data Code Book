## Code book for Samsung tidy table

Intro

This data is derived from a much larger set of 563 different motion measurements taken from a Samsung phone carried by 30 subjects during an experiment to distinguish and predict six types activity. 

In this subset, 79 variables that recorded the mean or standard deviation for that measurement are included. Mean values for each variable are reported by subject and activity.

For example, Column 3 reports the mean standard deviation of 't-bodyacc-std-x' for subject 1 and the activity 'standing'.  

The variable names are fine-tuned to represent the variety of different measurements and their source. Further details can be found at:

Vars 1-2

 [1] "subject"                       
 		factor, 1-30, for each of 30 subjets
 
 [2] "activity" 
        factor, for each of 6 activities: "standing", "sitting", "laying", "walking", "walking downstairs", "walking upstairs"   
 
Vars 3-22
	These numeric variables represent time domain signals (prefix 't') that captured body and gravity acceleration from the accelerometer (acc) and gyroscope (gyro). x, y and z indicate the dimension of motion. 'jerk' is a derived measurment of angular velocity and body linear acceleration.

	These numeric variables, prefixed with 'f', report measurements that have been transformed iwth a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and were used to estimate each activity pattern.
